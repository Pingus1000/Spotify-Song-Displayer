This Pythonprogram will grab your curent playing Song from the Spotify API and write in a File. With this File you can display the Song on your Stream with OBS or do whatever you want with tis Information.

Its very simple. You need Python installed (and the package `requests`).

This is hard to explain and you need some Programming Knowledge. If you familiar with the Spotify API: Your Token need the `user-read-currently-playing` Scope. If you dont know about the Spotify API and OAuth Token write me on Discord (`Pingus1000#6367`) or on Twitter (`@Pingus10001`)
